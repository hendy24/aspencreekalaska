Assisted Living is a wonderful option for seniors who don’t need or want institutionalized care but do want maximum convenience and opportunities for enrichment.
Assisted Living is a supportive senior living option that promotes independence and personal dignity in a safe, home-like environment. 
Assisted Living is a maintenance-free lifestyle where residents make their home in a private suite with full access to all amenities the community offers.
Each resident has an assisted services program tailored to their individual needs. The customized care plan can include daily personal assistance services, such as dressing, bathing, meals, housekeeping, and medication assistance and management.
Assisted Living offers amenities including entertainment, exercise, activities, dining, and transportation.

								Assisted Living Residents can be individuals or couples. They are independent but desire the freedom of knowing that the day-to-day details of life will be handled and that they can receive assistance with activities of daily living, like medication assistance, bathing, dressing, and grooming. They like that nutritious menus are created by a registered dietitian and meals are prepared the Executive Chef and that there are many social and enrichment activities available throughout the day.

								Yes. We use a wearable device created specifically for Senior Living environments. If a resident needs assistance, they simply press a button on their device and our staff will be notified of their need and location. The wearable device uses machine learning to give meaningful, individualized insights into the overall well-being of each resident.
